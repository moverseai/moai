# INTER_NEAREST – a nearest-neighbor interpolation
# INTER_LINEAR – a bilinear interpolation (used by default)
# INTER_AREA – resampling using pixel area relation. It may be a preferred method for image decimation, as it gives moire’-free results. But when the image is zoomed, it is similar to theINTER_NEAREST method.
# INTER_CUBIC – a bicubic interpolation over 4×4 pixel neighborhood
# INTER_LANCZOS4 – a Lanczos interpolation over 8×8 pixel neighborhood
